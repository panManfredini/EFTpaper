\section{Introduction}
%	Astrophysical and cosmological observations present evidence that 27\% of the mass-energy of the Universe is made out of Dark Matter (DM), a non-luminous, non-baryonic and non-relativistic particle, though the nature of this particle is yet unknown~\cite{Harvey1462}. While several types of new DM candidate raise from many theories, the most prominent one is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs)~\cite{Bertone:2010zza}. Many  direct detection experiments attempt to measure the rare scattering of WIMPs from target nucleus. Although some experiment see an excess for WIMPs in the mass range of 6-30 GeV/$C^2$~\cite{DAMA,COGENT,CDMSlite,CREST}, these results are in tension with other experiments~\cite{xe100_run_combination,PANDAX,LUXnew}.

Astrophysical and cosmological observations provide strong evidence that \BenComment{about 25\%} of the \RanComment{energy density} of the universe is made out of Dark Matter (DM), a non-luminous, non-baryonic, and non-relativistic particle, the nature of which is yet unknown~\cite{Harvey1462,WMAP:9years,PLANCK}. Many well-motivated theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of one or more particles with the required properties, with masses \RanComment{and cross sections} typically of the order of the weak scale. Such particles are collectively known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs)~\cite{Bertone:2010zza}. The hypothesis that dark matter is constituted primarily of WIMPs is currently being tested by many experiments, either indirectly by seaching for evidence of their possible decay or annihilation in astrophysical processes, by searching for evidence of their direct production at collider experiments, or by directly measuring the rare scattering of astrophysical WIMPs from target nuclei in Earth-based laboratories. We report on a search of this last kind. Although \RanComment{there are} still reported potential evidence for WIMPs in the mass range of 6-30 GeV/$c^2$~\cite{DAMA,}, these results appear to conflict with null results from other experiments~\cite{xe100_run_combination,PANDAX,LUXnew,COGENT,CDMSlite,CREST}.

%	 Typically the standard calculation for WIMP-nucleon scattering simplifies the type of interaction to Spin Independent (SI) and Spin Dependent (SD) interactions~\cite{LEWIN}, however these are not the only possible types of interactions. In recent years an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach that takes into account all leading-order and next-to-leading order operators that emerge from an effective Lagrangian describing the WIMP-nucleus interaction has been developed ~\cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ib,Anand:MathTools,Fitzpatrick:MathTools}. In this framework new operators which come from different type of nuclear responses are introduced along with the standard SI and SD ones. The parametrization of the fourteen operators $\mathcal{O}_i$ is listed in Eq.~\ref{eq:OpDef} and follows the convention from~\cite{Anand:MathTools}. The operators dependence explicitly on 4 quantities: $\vec{v}^{\perp}$, the relative velocity between the WIMP and the nucleon, $\vec{q}$, the momentum transfer, and the WIMP and nucleon spin $\vec{S}_\chi$ , $\vec{S}_N$. Notice that $\mathcal{O}_2$ is not treated as it cannot be obtained from a relativistic operator at leading order.

The traditional approach for computing predictions of the rate of WIMP-nucleon scattering has been to take only leading-order terms in a WIMP-nucleon effective field theory (EFT) with a very simple treatment of nuclear structure~\cite{LEWIN}. This leads to two main types of interactions, which are commonly labelled ``Spin Independent'' (SI) and ``Spin Dependent'' (SD), however in recent years many authors have been pointed out that in certain theories these interactions may be suppressed or nonexistent, such that otherwise subleading interactions may dominate the scattering process. To account for this possibility in a systematic way a more sophisticated EFT approach has been developed ~\cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ib,Anand:MathTools,Fitzpatrick:MathTools}, \BenComment{in which an effective Lagrangian describing the WIMP-nucleus interaction is constructed that takes into account all Gallilean-invariant operators up to second order in the momentum exchange}. In this framework new operators associated with different types of nuclear responses are introduced along with the standard SI and SD ones, resulting in a set of fourteen operators $\mathcal{O}_i$ which may each couple independently to protons and neutrons. In Eq. (\ref{eq:OpDef}) we list these operators following the convention from~\cite{Anand:MathTools}. The operators depend explicitly on 4 linearly independent quantities: $\vec{v}^{\perp} \equiv \vec{v} + \frac{\vec{q}}{2\mu_N} $, the relative perpendicular velocity between the WIMP and the nucleon, $\vec{q}$, the momentum transferred in the scattering event, and $\vec{S}_\chi$, $\vec{S}_N$, the WIMP and nucleon spins. $\mathcal{O}_2$ is not considered here as it cannot be obtained from a relativistic operator at leading order.

\begin{align*} 
&\mathcal{O}_1 = 1_{\chi} 1_N  \\
%&\mathcal{O}_2 = (v^{\perp})^2 \\
&\mathcal{O}_3 = i\vec{S}_N\cdot (\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\times\vec{v}^\perp) \\
&\mathcal{O}_4 = \vec{S}_{\chi}\cdot \vec{S}_N \\
&\mathcal{O}_5 = i\vec{S}_{\chi}\cdot (\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}\times\vec{v}^\perp) \\
&\mathcal{O}_6 = (\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N})(\vec{S}_N \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}) \\
&\mathcal{O}_7 = \vec{S}_N \cdot \vec{v}^\perp \\
&\mathcal{O}_8 = \vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot \vec{v}^\perp \numberthis \label{eq:OpDef} \\
&\mathcal{O}_9 = i\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot(\vec{S}_N \times \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}) \\
&\mathcal{O}_{10} = i\vec{S}_N \cdot (\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}) \\
&\mathcal{O}_{11} = i\vec{S}_{\chi} \cdot (\frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}) \\
&\mathcal{O}_{12} = \vec{S}_\chi \cdot (\vec{S}_N \times \vec{v}^\perp) \\
&\mathcal{O}_{13} = i(\vec{S}\chi \cdot \vec{v}^\perp)(\vec{S}_N \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N})\\
&\mathcal{O}_{14} = i(\vec{S}_\chi \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N})(\vec{S}_N \cdot \vec{v}^\perp) \\
&\mathcal{O}_{15} = -(\vec{S}_\chi \cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N})[(\vec{S}_N \times \vec{v}^\perp)\cdot \frac{\vec{q}}{m_N}]
\end{align*}

 
%	    Unlike The formally studied types of interaction (SI,SD) which are not suppressed when $\vec{q} \rightarrow 0$ and most of their interaction rate will be in low energies recoils, some of the new operators depend explicitly on $\vec{q}$ therefore their interaction rate is suppressed with $\vec{q}$ and peaks at higher energies than previously looked in direct detection experiments ($< 43$ keV), and hence could not be treated before see Fig. ~\ref{fig:dRdE}.
	    Unlike the more commonly studied types of interaction (SI,SD), which are not suppressed when $\vec{q} \rightarrow 0$ and for which the scattering rate on nucleons is expected to be largest for low energy nuclear recoils, some of the new EFT operators depend explicitly on $\vec{q}$ and so their interaction cross section is suppressed for low momentum transfers. Consequently, their scattering rate peaks at non-zero nuclear recoil energy, which for sufficiently high WIMP masses may even occur outside typical analysis windows ($< 43$~keV) which are designed to search for SI and SD interactions (see Figure~\ref{fig:dRdE}). \BenComment{Due to this theoretical bias, high energy nuclear recoils have remained unexplored in many experiments}.
	    
%	    Another assumption that can be relaxed is that WIMP should scatter elastically, however there are models in which the incoming and outgoing WIMPs have different mass states ~\cite{InelasticIntro}. In the case where the outgoing state is more massive than the incoming state the event rate at low recoil energies can again be suppressed, hence analyses which apply an upper energy bound lose sensitivity to these types of interactions. Recently an inelastic adaptation of the EFT operator framework discussed above was developed~\cite{InelasticMath}. The operators presented in~\ref{eq:OpDef} are modified such that $\vec{v}^\perp_{inelastic} = \vec{v}^\perp_{elastic} +\frac{\delta}{\vert{\vec{q}}\vert^2}\vec{q}$. \RanComment{We should add here the dependency of $v_{min}$ on $\delta$}      
	    Another typical assumption that can be relaxed is that WIMPs should scatter elastically with nuclei, however there exist dark matter models in which the incoming and outgoing WIMPs have different mass states ~\cite{InelasticIntro} separated by a keV-scale splitting. In the case where the outgoing state is more massive than the incoming state the cross section for low recoil energies can again be suppressed, this time by the scattering kinematics. Recently an inelastic adaptation of the EFT operator framework discussed above was developed~\cite{InelasticMath}. In this case the operators presented in Eq.~\ref{eq:OpDef} are modified such that $\vec{v}^\perp_{inelastic} = \vec{v}^\perp_{elastic} +\frac{\delta_m}{\vert{\vec{q}}\vert^2}\vec{q}$. We discuss this case further in section \ref{subsubsec:Inelastic}.
	    
The EFT framework of \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ib} is constructed at the WIMP-nucleon level and so each operator may be present independently for protons and neutrons, though UV models can of course correlate their couplings. The full EFT thus has 28 coupling parameters in addition to the WIMP mass, and, in the inelastic case, a mass splitting $\delta$. The parameter space is thus too large to explore in full, so we take a similar approach to the SI/SD case and characterize the experimental limit by assuming only one active operator at a time, with the coupling to protons and neutrons for that operator set equal (the ``isoscalar'' case). However, to facilitate the full exploitation of these results by the community, we provide in supplementary material a set of tools for converting any theoretical recoil spectrum $\mathrm{d}R/\mathrm{d}E$ into an accurate event rate prediction for this analysis, including all detector response and analysis efficiency effects. This may help to set a mildly conservative but quite accurate limit on arbitrary models in the full EFT parameter space, or indeed any other particle dark matter model for which one can supply the expected recoil spectrum.

In this paper, motivated by these EFT extensions of the standard WIMP framework, we report on an analysis extending the searched recoil energy range up to 240\,keV for the first time in the \Xehund\ experiment, and present exclusion limits on all operators for both the elastic and the inelastic WIMP cases.     
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Motivation: dark matter, theoretical possibility of high energy recoil events. Mention some specific models, maybe inelastic scattering also.
%  \item Theoretical background ongate grid is very technical, and not described in section II. Why not reword to "propagation through the liquid xenon" EFT operators, inc. motivation (e.g. possibility to reconcile limits vs possible signals in other experiments, model-independent approach to constraining exotic models)
%  \item (if we do it) Theoretical background on inelastic scattering kinematics.
%  \item Motivating example plots of recoil spectra/signal models (e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:dRdE}). Also discuss the lower electronic recoil background at these higher recoil energies, which improves the analysis sensitivity beyond what would be expected from the raw increase in predicted event rate (At least I presume so, need to estimate this perhaps. I think we can say something like this; the standard analysis signal region has a signal acceptance of maybe 50\% since it cuts the nuclear recoil band about in half, whereas for us it is almost 90\% since there is good separation between ER and NR bands. So for say O3 (either mass) we expect about twice as many events due to the extended signal region, with twice the acceptance in the new high PE region. So overall I guess it is roughly a factor of 3 improvement in total signal rate, and similar for the sensitivity. In fact from the proper sensitivity estimates the improvement is a little better than that, but this gives a rough idea where the improvement comes from.).

\caption{Example EFT recoil spectra for elastic scattering of spin-$1/2$ WIMPs on Xenon nuclei (weighted according to the isotope abundances in the XENON100 experiment). Left(right) shows the predicted spectra for EFT operator $\mathcal{O}_1$($\mathcal{O}_6$). The normalization is controlled by the coupling coefficient of each EFT operator and the experimental exposure (left arbitrary in this figure). The solid vertical line at 43 keV shows the approximate division between the two signal regions used in this analysis (30 PE in cS1). As shown, the standard SI ($\mathcal{O}_1$) spectrum is concentrated mainly in the already explored energy region. However, some EFT operators, for certain WIMP masses, predict a significant fraction of recoil events above the upper energy cut used in the standard spin-independent analysis, motivating an extension of this cut. The highest recoil energy shown in the plots, 240\,keV, roughly corresponds to the extended $cS1$ cut of 180\,PE used in this analysis.}

\section{The \Xehund\  Detector}
The \Xehund\ detector is a cylindrical %30\,cm~height, 30\,cm~diameter, 
dual-phase xenon (liquid and gas) time projection chamber (TPC). It is installed at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy
and hosts 161\,kg of liquid xenon (LXe), of which 62\,kg function as the active target ~\cite{xe100_instr2012}. 
The detector consists of a total of 178~1-inch square Hamamatsu R8520-AL photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) employed in two arrays, one in the gas phase at the top of the TPC, and the other at the bottom, immersed in the LXe. 

A particle interacting with the LXe deposits energy that creates both
\RanComment{prompt scintillation (S1) and delayed proportional one (S2) which are detected using the two PMTs array. The S2 signal is produced by ionized electrons, drifted in an electric field of $530$V/cm towards the liquid-gas interface, where they are extracted using a stronger electric field of $\sim12$kV/cm to the gas phase in which the proportional scintillation occurs. }
The spatial distribution of the $S2$ signal on the top PMT array, together with the time difference between $S1$ and $S2$ signals, provide respectively X-Y and Z position information for each interaction, allowing 3D position reconstruction to be achieved.
%determines the X-Y position, while the time difference between the two signals gives the z-coordinate, and thus a 3D position reconstructions is achieved.

\sout{Interactions in different positions cover different solid angles with respect to the PMT array, which leads to a position-dependent S1 signal. At the same time, warping of the top meshes and the absorption of electrons by residual impurities lead to a position-dependent S2 signal}. \RanComment{Interaction in different locations in the detector has different signatures. In order to take these effects into account a correction is applied based on a light collection efficiency (LCE) map. This map is prepared using calibration sources ranging up to energies well above 240$\keVr$, which is the highest energy recoil considered in this paper. The corrected signals (cS1,cS2) are spatially independent and uniform to all interactions~\cite{xe100_instr2012}. Note that as some of the top PMTs saturate for large S2 signals, we use in this analysis only the bottom PMTs array for energy scale in S2.}

The $S2/S1$ ratio is known to differ between nuclear recoil (NR) and electronic recoil (ER) interactions, and is thus used as a discriminating variable between a WIMP signal and ER background.

The logarithm of this ratio, log($cS2_b/cS1$) is referred later in the text as the y discriminating variable.

% between ER background coming from $\gamma$, $\beta$ and NR signal coming from a WIMP.
