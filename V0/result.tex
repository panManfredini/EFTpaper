\subsection{Elastic Scattering}
\RanComment{ A benchmark region of interest is defined between the upper and lower thresholds in cS1 for each channel. This region
is bounded in y space from above by the $^{241}$AmBe NR mean line and below by the lower 3$\sigma$ quantile of the AmBe neutron calibration data. The expected background in the region is $3 \pm 0.5$ (lowE) and $1.41 \pm 0.28$ (highE). The number of DM candidates recorded in this region is 3 (lowE), and 0 (highE). }
sout{A total of 50 events are recorded in the signal region distributed in the bins as defined in Table~\ref{table:BinDef}.} The data is compatible with background only hypothesis and no excess is found. For all operators and masses in the range of 10 Gev/$c^2$ to 1TeV$c^2$, \Xehund\ sets the strongest limits on the effective coupling constant $c_i$. These limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:elasticLimit} in black, along with the limits from CDMS-II Si, CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS~\cite{CDMSEFT}. For operators 3 and 8, a full CDMS limit is presented, for all other operators only the limit for a 10 GeV/$c^2$ and 300 GeV/$c^2$ are published.

Limits from CDMS-II Si CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS cite{CDMS} are presented in blue Astrix ,green triangle and orange rectangle (color online). For operator 3 and 8 a full limit from CDMS is published and indicated by a dashed line in the respected colors.}

\subsection{Inelastic Scattering}
The limit of inelastic scattering for the SI case ($\mathcal{O}_1$) is shown both as a function of mass splitting and WIMP mass in Fig.~\ref{fig:O1Inel}. Each line represents the 90\% CL for a specific coupling constant value. 

The limits for all other operators are calculated for a WIMP mass of 1 TeV/$c^2$ as a function of the mass splitting $\delta_m$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:InelasticLimit})
