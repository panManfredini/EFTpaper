\section{Results}
\subsection{Elastic Scattering}
A total of 50 events are recorded in the signal region distributed in the bins as defined in table ... . The data is compatible with background only hypothesis and no excess is found. For all operators and all masses in the range of 10$Gev/c^2$ \Xehund\ sets the strongest limits on the effective coupling constant $c_i$. 

Limits on all operators are shown in Fig ~\ref{fig:elasticLimit} along with the limits from CDMS-II Si CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS cite{add citation CDMS}. For operators 3 and 8 a full CDMS limit is presented, for all other operators only the limit for a 10GeV and 300GeV are published.

\caption{The \Xehund\ limits (90\% CL) Limits on isoscalar dimensionless coupling for all elastic scattering EFT operators are indicated in solid black. The expected sensitivity obtained assuming background only are is shown in green and yellow(1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ respectively). Limits from CDMS-II Si CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS cite{CDMS} are presented in blue Astrix ,green triangle and orange rectangle (color online). For operator 3 and 8 a full limit from CDMS is published and is indicated by a dashed line in the respected colors.}
