\subsection{The Likelihood Function}
\label{sec:LikelihoodFunction}
The statistical interpretation of data is performed by means of a binned profiled likelihood approach, hypothesis testing rely on a likelihood ratio test statistic, $\tilde{q}$, 
and its asymptotic distributions~\cite{asympt}. The statistical combination between the two analysis channels is achieved merely by the product of the likelihood functions,
%for the low ($\Llike_{\mathrm{lowE}}$) and high  ($\Llike_{\mathrm{highE}}$) energy channels as shown in equation~\ref{eq:FullLikelihood}. 
note that the parametrization of the uncertainty related to $\Leff$  is considered correlated between the two channels. %, as stressed by the common constraint term $\Llike_{\Leff}$.
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:FullLikelihood}
%\Llike = \Llike_{\mathrm{lowE}} \times \Llike_{\mathrm{highE}} \times \Llike_{\Leff}
%\end{equation}

For the low energy channel an extended likelihood function is employed very similarly to what reported in~\cite{Aprile:2011hx} and described in detail in~\cite{xe100_run_combination}, 
only briefly summarized here. The discriminating variable are cS1 and cS2 in the ROI described in section~\ref{}, the phase space is divided into eight WIMP mass dependent bands
where events are counted, this binned approach is extended with the corresponding cS1 probability density functions.
The total normalization of the background is a parameter of the model and fit to data. 
An uncertainty  is assigned to the relative normalization of each bands according to the corresponding statistical uncertainty of the calibration sample.
%The MLE of the background expectation in each band is constrained by the statistical uncertainty of the calibration sample in that band. 
Parametrization of energy scale uncertainties is performed as described in~\cite{} for $\Leff$ and in~\cite{} $\Qy$ signal model parameters, complex signal 
shape variations are modeled via simulation.

The high energy channel employs a binned likelihood fuction defined in the (cS1,cS2)-region described in section~\ref{}. Observed and expected event yield are
compared in the 9 bins, the extended approach described above was not advisable given the large statistical uncertainty of the backround model.
The MLE of the background expectation in each bin is constrained by the statistical uncertainty of the calibration sample, while the total 
normalization is fit to the data. Additionally, \textcolor{blue}{to take into account effects (like gammaX.... to say better) a systematic uncertainty of 20\% is assigned to each bin}.
Uncertainty on the signal acceptance to analysis selection are introduced as described in section~\ref{}, uncertainty on the $\Leff$ are parametrized as described above.





%For the high energy channel a binned likelihood fuction has been chosen, defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:HighELikelihood}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:HighELikelihood}
%\Llike_{\mathrm{highE}}(c_k^2,\Leff) = \prod_{i} \big( Poiss(n^{obs}_{i}~|~n^{s}_{i} + n^{b}_{i}) \, \times Gauss(\eta^{b}_{i}) \big) ~ \times \Llike_{stat}(\epsilon^{s}_{j},\epsilon^{b}_{i}) \times \Llike^s_{unc}(\Leff, A)
%\end{equation}
%where the product goes over all 9 bins, $\epsilon^{b}_{i}$ is the fraction of background event in \textbf{bin} $i$ and  $\epsilon^{s}_{j}$ is the fraction of AmBe data in \textbf{band} $j$. This means the uncertainty on the signal is assessed per band. $n_i^s = N_{tot}^s(c_k^2,\Leff) \times z_{i,j}^s(\Leff ,\epsilon^{s}_{j})$ is the number of signal events in bin i, $z_{i,j}^s(\Leff, \epsilon^{s}_{j})$ is the fraction of signal events in bin i which is in band j. $n_i^b = N_{tot}^{cal} \times \tau \times \epsilon^{b}_{i}(\eta^{b}_{i})$ is the number of background events in bin i. $\tau$ is the overall normalization of background to data, and is a free parameter.  
%
%The statistical uncertainties on the bins are constrained via:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:LstsatHighE}
%\Llike_{stat}(\epsilon^{s}_{j},\epsilon^{b}_{i}) = \prod_{i}Poiss(N_i^{cal}~|~N_{tot}^{cal} \times \epsilon^{b}_{i}) \times \prod_j Poisson(N_j^{AmBe} | N_{tot}^{AmBe} \times \epsilon^{s}_{j})
%\end{equation}
%while the uncertainties on the signal model are treated in 
%\begin{equation}
%\Llike^s_{unc}(\Leff, A) = Gauss(A) \times Gauss(\Leff)
%\end{equation}
%
%The uncertainty on the acceptance depend on the expected signal and varies between $\sim$0.01\% to $\sim$7\%. $\eta^{b}_{i}$ is the background systematic uncertainty in bin i and is taken to be 20\%. An additional shape uncertainty due to $\Leff$ is also considered.   
%
%The lowE likelihood function is adopted from previous analyses and is \begin{equation}
%\label{eq:LowELikelihood}
%\Llike_{lowE} = \Llike_1(c_k^2,\Leff,\Qy) \Llike_2(\epsilon_b) \Llike_3(\Leff,\Qy) .
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:LowELikelihood1}
%\begin{split}
%\Llike_1(c_k^2,\Leff,\Qy) = &\prod_j Poiss(n^j|\epsilon_s^jM_s(c_k^2)+\epsilon_b^jM_b) \times  \\
%&\prod_{i=1}^{n^{i,j}} \frac{\epsilon_s^j M_s(c_k^2)f_s^j(cS1^i) + \epsilon_b^j M_bf_b^j(cS1^i)}{\epsilon^j_sM_s + \epsilon^j_bM_b} ,
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $f^j_s$ and $f^j_b$ are the probability density functions of the signal and background respectively in band j. and $M_s$ and $M_b$ are the maximum likelihood estimators for the total number of signal and background events respectively.
%\begin{equation}
%\Llike_2 = \prod_j Poiss(n^j_b | \epsilon_b^jN_b)
%\end{equation}
