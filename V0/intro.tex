\section{The \Xehund\  Detector}
The \Xehund\ detector is a cylindrical (30cm height X 30cm diameter) dual phase Xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) that holds 62 kg of Liquid \Xe\ (LXe) targets ~\cite{xe100_instr2012}. It operates at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. The detector consists a total of 242 1‚Äù-square Hamamatsu R8520-AL photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) employed in two arrays, at the top part (in the gas phase) and in the bottom immersed in LXe. a Particle interacting with the LXe deposits energy that creates both excited and ionized states. De-excitation creates a prompt scintillation signal ($S1$). ,  Ionized electrons are drifted in an electric field of $530$V/cm towards the liquid-gas interface, where they are extracted via a larger electric field of $\sim12$kV/cm. These electrons generates a proportional scintillation, which is called $S2$. The spatial distribution of the $S2$ signal on the top PMT array, determines the X-Y position, while the time difference between the two signals gives the z-coordinate, and thus a 3D position reconstructions is achieved.

The ratio of S2/S1 is different weather the interaction is nuclear recoil (NR) or electronic recoil (ER) and thus this ratio is used as a discriminator between ER background coming from $\gamma$, $\beta$ and NR signal coming from a WIMP. 

In previous \Xehund\ analyses the determination of the recoil energy was based on the size of S1 and the scintillation efficiency for the nuclear recoils, \Leff ~\cite{xe100_run10_si}. However in the last analysis ~\cite{xe100_run_combination} a new method was adopted taking into advantage also the S2 signal.
