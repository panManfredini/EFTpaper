\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:Analysis}
In this work we re-analyze  scientific run~II data recorded between February 2011 and March 2012, 
corresponding to 224.6~live~days. The characterization of the detector response to ER interactions is performed using dedicated calibration campaigns with $^{60}$Co and $^{232}$Th radioactive sources, while for the detector response to NR interactions $^{241}$AmBe calibration campaigns are performed.
%\sout{as well as for estimating the background from $\beta$ and $\gamma$-particles. For the ER sample we expose the detector to $^{60}$Co and $^{232}$Th sources, while for the NR sample we use $^{241}$AmBe.}

 
This work extends the previous results~\cite{xe100_run10_si,xe100_run_combination}, referred to in the following as the low energy channel, with a new study exploring the energy range between 43-240\,keV. 
The data analysis is divided into two mutually exclusive channels, one optimized for low energies and ranging from 3-30\,PE in cS1 (lowE), 
the other optimized for high energies recoils ranging from 30-180\,PE in cS1 (highE).  These two analysis are finally statistically combined. 
The relative region of interests (ROI) of these two channels are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phasespace} and further described in the following sections.

\subsection{High Energy}
\label{subsubsec:HighE}
This analysis channel explores high energy nuclear recoils and is the focus of this work. The data selection criteria described in detail in \cite{Aprile:2012vw} were optimized for high 
acceptance to low energy nuclear recoils.
Most of these selection criteria (cuts) were fully compatible or simply extended to high energy depositions, however some required
more comprehensive studies and are detailed in what follows. 

To reject peculiar events we compare the width of the S2 to its z-position. In this analysis we adopt a newer version of this cut, developed for scientific run III, see ~\cite{xe100_run_combination}, \Ale{can't you just paste what's written there for this cut} \RanComment{suprisingly no it is not described there , so either we do not describe it as well or keep it like this.}. As a WIMP will interact only once in the detector, we remove events which have more than one S2. We adopt here a cut that is more suitable to higher energies and demands a single S2 in a 160 $\mu$S window \Ale{need to state what was before} \RanComment{instead of a linear dependace between the secon S2 size and the first one.}. To define the interaction's exact location, we use several algorithms, one of which is based on a Neural Network (NN)~\cite{Aprile:2012vw}. The NN was not trained to recognize high energy ER event and therefore \ale{not suitable for this analysis.} \Ale{This cut is based on the difference between NN and chisquare? Posreq?} 
\sout{gives a large $\chi^2$ for them. In order to not underestimate the background we drop this cut. We do keep other cuts on position reconstruction to make sure we can identify the exact location of interactions.} 
\Ale{either we explain or not mention.}

The total acceptance to WIMP signals is computed based on $^{241}$AmBe calibration data based on  the procedure described in~\cite{Aprile:2012vw} as a function of cS1
 and presented  in Figure~\ref{fig:Acc}, the total acceptance is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial.

\end{figure}

We define our signal region in the discrimination (y,cS1)-plane using $^{241}$AmBe calibration data. 
The ROI is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phasespace} as blue contour lines: the upper bound is defined such that it is not contaminated from contribution due to xenon excitation lines, the lower is defined as the 3\,$\sigma$ acceptance quantile of the $^241$AmBe distribution.

We divide our signal region into two bands, they are constructed such that the $^{241}$AmBe data sample is equally distributed in y between them. The total number of events in a band is $\sim3000$ events. The bands are further divided into nine bins. The definition and content of the bins is presented in table~\ref{table:BinDef} and in Figure~\ref{fig:phasespace}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%% THIS PROBABLY NEEDS A SECTION, explaining well the uncertainty determination %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The main source of background results from  ER leakage and hence, we estimate our background using $^{60}$Co and $^{232}$Th calibration samples 
\sout{defining the distribution between the bins} \Ale{don't get it}. 
Contribution from radiogenic and cosmogenic neutrons, \sout{and accidental coincidence}\RanComment{this is due to FV 34kg ???} \Ale{why remove Acc?} 
are negligible for such a high energy recoil.
For illustration purposes we report in Table~\ref{table:BinDef} the background expectation for each ROI bin along side with the observed data events. The background expectation is computed by scaling the calibration sample yield by $6.54\times10^{-3}$, which is merely the ratio of observed data and calibration in an independent sideband. Note that in the background normalization is fitted to data during hypothesis testing, as described in section~\ref{section:stat}. 

\Ale{Add at least a good sentence about determination of background uncertainty.} \RanComment{Isn't this explained in the stat part? you are talking about the systematic of 20\% or on statistical poisson?}

\subsection{Signal Model}
\label{subsec:SignalModel}
In summary, the signal model is produced by taking a theoretical event rate spectrum, the production of which is described in sections \ref{subsubsec:Elastic} and \ref{subsubsec:Inelastic}, and applying the analysis acceptance and detector response as described in ~\cite{xe100_ana2012} \RanComment{adopting the modification stated above,} to obtain the expected event rate in the detector in terms of detector variables (i.e. cS1,cS2). \sout{Since the nature of the analysis is quite different in each of our two signal regions, we use different signal models for each region; a 1D, \cSi-only model for the new high energy region, and a full 2D, \{\cSi,\cSiib\} model for the `standard' low energy region, as described in \cite{xe100_run_combination}} \RanComment{We adopt different methods because of different reasons, plus the term 1D and 2D is confusing, we calculate the s1 and s2 for both cases}. 

\RanComment{Moved this paragraph here}
We now discuss details of the signal models. \sout{The lowE 2D signal model is computed according to Eq.~\ref{eq:low2D}}
In order to calculate the expected value of the signal in cS1, we use Eq.~\ref{eq:LeffEnergyScale} for both energy regions, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LeffEnergyScale}
	cS1 = E_{\mathrm{nr}} \cdot (\Ly \Leff)(E_{\mathrm{nr}})\cdot   \left(\frac{S_{nr}}{S_{ee}}\right) 
\end{equation}
%\begin{multline}
%\label{eq:low2D}
%  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 R}{\mathrm{d}\cSi.\mathrm{d}\cSiib} = \epsilon_\mathrm{S1}(\cSi).\epsilon_\mathrm{S2}(\cSiib) \\ 
%  \times \int \! \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}E}.p_\mathrm{S1}(\mathrm{\cSi}|E).p_\mathrm{S2}(\mathrm{\cSiib}|E) \, \mathrm{d}E
%\end{multline}

%where
%
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:S1S2pdf}
% p_\mathrm{S1}(\mathrm{\cSi}|E) &= \sum_{N'} P_\mathrm{pmt}(\mathrm{\cSi}|N',0.5 \sqrt{N'}).\mathrm{Pois}(N'|\mu_\gamma) \\
% p_\mathrm{S2}(\mathrm{\cSiib}|E) &= \sum_{N'} P_\mathrm{pmt}(\mathrm{\cSiib}|Y N',\sigma_Y \sqrt{N'}).\mathrm{Pois}(N'|\mu_Q)
%\end{align}
%
%where $P_\mathrm{pmt}$ is a normal distribution with arguments as $N(x|\mu,\sigma)$, and where
%
%\begin{align}
%\mu_\gamma(E) &\approx E \cdot L_y \cdot L_\mathrm{eff}(E) \cdot \frac{S_\mathrm{nr}}{S_\mathrm{ee}} \\
%\mu_Q(E) &\approx Q_y(E) \cdot E
%\end{align}

with fixed parameters $L_y = 2.28$, $S_\mathrm{nr} = 0.95$, $S_\mathrm{ee} = 0.58$, \sout{$Y = 8.4366$, and $\sigma_Y = 6.93$}, where $E$ is the recoil energy, $\Leff$ is the scintillation efficiency relative to 122$\keVee$, $\Ly$ is the light yield, \sout{$\Qy$ is the charge yield, $Y$ is an amplification factor}, and $S_{ee}$ and $S_{nr}$ are the quenching factors for ER and NR respectively. Recoils below 3 keV are assumed to produce no light since $\Leff$ is not measured at these energies. For details of the physics behind these parameters please see \cite{xe100_ana2012,xe100_run_combination}. \RanComment{For the lowE region, S2 can be calculated as well~\cite{DataMCXenon}, using Eq.~\ref{eq:Qy}, where $Y = 8.4366$ is the amplification factor determined from the detector response to single electrons~\cite{XenonSingleElectron}, and $\Qy$ is the charge yield. Note that as some of the top PMTs saturate we use only the bottom PMT for energy scale in S2. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Qy}
	cS2_{bottom} = E_{\mathrm{nr}}\Qy Y   
\end{equation}  } \sout{Note also that, as some of the top PMTs saturate, we use only the bottom PMTs for the energy scale.}  \RanComment{Taking into account the detector and PMT responses, and the acceptance as in \cite{xe100_run_combination} \sout{Finally, the signal model is defined} deffines the lowE signal model over the region $3 \mathrm{PE} < \cSi < 30 \mathrm{PE}$, with $\cSiib > 73.5 \mathrm{PE}$, \sout{and with acceptances as in \cite{xe100_run_combination}}}.

\RanComment{I moved this paragraph here}
For the high energy region we can not produce the S2 distribution as the method in~\cite{DataMCXenon} is not calibrated for high enough energies. Therefore we use the NR calibration data distribution in log($\mathrm{cS2_b/cS1}$) to estimate the WIMP one. Above 180PE in \cSi\ the statistics of $^{241}$AmBe data is too low to estimate the distribution accurately and therefore this is the higher bound of this analysis. We therefore require only a prediction of the \cSi\ distribution. Applying detector and PMT responses, as well as the acceptance given in~\ref{fig:Acc} defines the highE signal model.

Examples of each for two EFT operators are shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:HighE} and \ref{fig:LowE}, with the rate normalized to give 5 events in the total energy range (lowE and highE).

\subsubsection{Elastic Scattering}
\label{subsubsec:Elastic}

The expected recoil energy spectrum of each WIMP mass for each EFT operator is calculated using the Mathematica package \texttt{DMFormFactor} supplied by Anand et. al.~\cite{Fitzpatrick:MathTools,Anand:MathTools}. We use standard assumptions as in previous analyses (e.g \cite{xe100_run_combination}) regarding the local dark matter density and velocity distribution, namely $\rho_\mathrm{local} = 0.3$ GeV/cm\textsuperscript{3} and a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution with a mean given by the local circular velocity $v_0 = 220$ km/s and cut off at an escape velocity of $v_\mathrm{esc} = 544$ km/s. The responses of Xe nuclei to a scattering event are computed from one-body density matrices provided with the package, in contrast to the Helm form factors which have been used in previous analyses. These spectra are produced for the seven most abundant Xe isotopes (128,129,130,131,132,134 and 136), combined in proportion to the abundance of these isotopes in the experiment \cite{xe100_run10_sd}, then translated into expected signal rates via the method described above.

\subsubsection{Inelastic WIMP Scattering}
\label{subsubsec:Inelastic}

To obtain recoil spectra for WIMP-nucleon scattering for all EFT operators with inelastic kinematics, we use a modified version of \texttt{DMFormFactor} provided by Barello et. al. \cite{InelasticMath}. Assumptions regarding the dark matter halo and nuclear physics are unchanged. The mass splitting $\delta$ between dark matter states is varied from 0 to \sout{1000} \RanComment{300} keV, \sout{well} beyond the value at which the predicted rate is zero for the entire mass range we consider (\RanComment{we see nothing above 250keV mass splitting}) \BenComment{perhaps I should see what number that actually is}.
