Astrophysical and cosmological observations present evidence that 27\% of the mass-energy of the Universe is made out of Dark Matter (DM), a non-luminous, non-baryonic and non-relativistic particle, though the nature of this particle is yet unknown~\cite{Harvey1462}. While several types of new DM candidate raise from many theories, the most prominent one is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs)~\cite{Bertone:2010zza}. Many  direct detection experiments attempt to measure the rare scattering of WIMPs from target nucleus. Although some experiment see an excess for WIMPs in the mass range of 6-30 GeV/$C^2$~\cite{DAMA,COGENT,CDMSlite,CREST}, these results are in tension with other experiments~\cite{xe100_run_combination,PANDAX,LUXnew}.
