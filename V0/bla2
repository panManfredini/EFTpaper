Astrophysical and cosmological observations present evidence that 27\% of the mass-energy of the Universe is made out of Dark Matter (DM), a non-luminous, non-baryonic and non-relativistic particle, the nature of which is yet unknown~\cite{Harvey1462}. Several well motivated theoretical models extends the Standard Model of particle physics predicting the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs)~\cite{Bertone:2010zza}. This hypotesis is currently being tested by many experiment either indirectly, or directly by  measuriring the rare scattering of WIMPs from target nuclei. Although some experiment see an excess for WIMPs in the mass range of 6-30 GeV/$C^2$~\cite{DAMA,COGENT,CDMSlite,CREST}, these results are not confirmed by other experiments~\cite{xe100_run_combination,PANDAX,LUXnew}.
