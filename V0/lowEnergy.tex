\subsection{Low Energy}
\label{subsec:LowE}
This analysis take advantage of the previous result~\cite{}, the analysis format, meaning the background model, data selections and their acceptances, 
statistical interpretation of data, is kept unchanged and only briefly summarized here. The only exception is the signal model production where 
minor differences are highlighted in Section~\ref{subsec:SignalModel}.

The region of interest for this channel.....
Those bands are defined based on a simulated signal model, arranged in order to have equal signal density in each.

Other than falling into the ROI an event should fullfill several other selection criteria such as, data quality cuts,
veto for events with energy release in the outer LXe shield, selection of single-scatter event, energy selection, S2 threshold cut and 
a predefined fiducial volume of 34\,kg. Details on these selections and on their relative acceptances on WIMP signals are detailed in~\cite{Aprile:2012vw}. 
Sentence on the advanced cuts.

Background model....
