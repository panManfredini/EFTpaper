%\subsection{Elastic Scattering}

A benchmark region of interest is defined between the upper and lower thresholds in \cSi{} for each channel. This region
is bounded in $y$-space from above by the $^{241}$AmBe NR mean line and below by the lower 3$\sigma$ quantile of the $^{241}$AmBe neutron calibration data. The expected background in the region is $3.0 \pm 0.5_{stat}$ (low-energy) and $1.4 \pm 0.3_{stat}$ (high-energy). The number of DM candidates in this benchmark region is 3 (low-energy), and 0 (high-energy). Consequently, the data is compatible with the background-only hypothesis and no excess is found. 

For the elastic scattering case, a 90\%\,CL$_S$~\cite{cls} confidence level limit is set on the effective coupling constant, $c_i$,  for all operators and masses in the range of 10~GeV/$c^2$ to 1 TeV/$c^2$. The $c_i$ are dimensionful, with units of $[\mathrm{mass}]^{-2}$, so we first convert them to dimensionless quantities by multiplying them by $m_\mathrm{weak}^2=(246.2\text{ GeV})^2$, following the conventions of \cite{Anand:MathTools}. 

These limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:elasticLimit} in black, along with limits from CDMS-II Si, CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS~\cite{CDMSEFT}.  


For the inelastic scattering case,  90\%\,CL$_S$ confidence level limits on the coupling constants 
(again scaled by $m_\mathrm{weak}^2$) are set. Fig.~\ref{fig:O1Inel} shows limits on the $\mathcal{O}_1$ (SI) coupling constant as a function of mass splitting and WIMP mass, Fig.~\ref{fig:InelasticLimit} shows limits for all other operators as a function of the mass splitting $\delta_m$ with a fixed WIMP mass of 1 TeV/$c^2$,  
projections of results from CDMS-II~\cite{CDMS_Inelastic}, ZEPLIN-III~\cite{Zepplin_Inel}, and \Xehund~\cite{XENON_Inelastic_WIMP} in the coupling constant and $\delta_m$ parameter space are also reported.

For the elastic operator $O_1$ our results can be compared to those of standard SI analyses by computing the relevant zero-momentum WIMP-nucleon cross-sections. This is not simple to do rigorously because the treatment of nuclear structure used in our analysis is different than in standard analyses, however this difference is small for scattering via $O_1$. We can therefore quite safely use the `traditional' correspondence~\cite{DeSimone:2016fbz}
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{N}^\mathrm{SI} = \left(C^N_1\right)^2 \frac{\mu_{\chi,N}^2}{\pi}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu_{\chi,N}$ is the WIMP-nucleon reduced mass. Standard SI analyses assume isospin-conserving interactions, as we do in this analysis, so we can simply set $C^N_1 = C^0_1$, such that $\sigma_{p}^\mathrm{SI}=\sigma_{n}^\mathrm{SI}$. 

In principle a similar comparison can be done between our limit on the $O_4$ coupling and standard SD analysis limits, however this time the standard analyses do {\em not} assume isospin-conserving interactions. Instead they typically assume maximal isospin violation, that is, assuming that WIMPs couple either protons or neutrons. Limits are then derived independently on $\sigma_{p}^\mathrm{SD}$ and $\sigma_{n}^\mathrm{SD}$. Because of this difference in assumptions, our limits on SD couplings are not directly comparable to usual analyses. However, they can be recast under the appropriate alternate model assumptions using the detector response tables we provide in the supplementary material.
