\section{Summary}
We have shown the first analysis of \Xehund\ data at recoil energies above 43 keV, with the new high energy bound set to 240 keV. We considered in this paper two models which predict interactions in this energy region: an EFT approach for elastic WIMP-nucleon scattering, and a similar EFT approach but considering instead inelastic WIMP-nucleon scattering. The observed data was compatible with background expectations, and 90\%\,CL$_S$ exclusion limits were constructed for WIMP masses between 10-1000 GeV. \RanComment{An even higher energy range, up to 1000~PE in \cSi{}, was examined without statistical analysis, with no candidate NR events found.}
