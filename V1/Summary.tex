\section{Summary}
We have shown the first analysis in \Xehund\ looking at energy recoils above 43 keV extending the high energy bound to 240 keV. We considered in this paper two models which predicts interactions in that energy region, an EFT approach for elastic WIMP nucleon scattering, and inelastic WIMP nucleon scattering. The data was compatible with background expectations, and 90\% exclusion limits were constructed, setting the strongest limit for these models, for WIMP masses between 10-1000 GeV.
