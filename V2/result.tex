%\subsection{Elastic Scattering}

A benchmark region of interest is defined between the upper and lower thresholds in cS1 for each channel. This region
is bounded in y space from above by the $^{241}$AmBe NR mean line and below by the lower 3$\sigma$ quantile of the AmBe neutron calibration data. The expected background in the region is $3 \pm 0.5$ (lowE) and $1.41 \pm 0.28$ (highE). The number of DM candidates recorded in this region is 3 (lowE), and 0 (highE). The data is compatible with the background-only hypothesis and no excess is found. 

For the elastic scattering case, a 90\%\,CL$_S$~\cite{cls} confidence limit is set on the effective coupling constant, $c_i$,  for all operators and masses in the range of 10 GeV/$c^2$ to 1 TeV/$c^2$. 
%\Xehund\ sets the strongest limits. % tomorrow another experiment will be better.
These limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:elasticLimit} in black, along with limits from CDMS-II Si, CDMS-II Ge and SuperCDMS~\cite{CDMSEFT}. For operators 3 and 8, a full CDMS limit is presented, for all other operators only the limit for a 10 GeV/$c^2$ and 300 GeV/$c^2$ are published.

%\subsection{Inelastic Scattering}
For the inelastic scattering case, 90\%\,CL$_S$ confidence limits on the coupling constants are set. Fig.~\ref{fig:O1Inel} shows limits on the $\mathcal{O}_1$ (SI) coupling constant as a function of mass splitting and WIMP mass, while Fig.~\ref{fig:InelasticLimit} shows limits for all other operators as a function of the mass splitting $\delta_m$ with a fixed WIMP mass of 1 TeV/$c^2$.
